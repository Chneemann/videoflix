    <h2 id="content3">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Relevant Legal Bases under the GDPR:</strong><br />
      The following is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we
      process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of
      the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our
      country of residence or domicile. If specific legal bases are relevant in
      individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR):</strong
        ><br />
        The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
        pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such
        interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
        freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany:</strong><br />
      In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national
      regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes, in
      particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG contains
      specific regulations on the right of access, the right to deletion, the
      right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data,
      the processing for other purposes, and the transmission and automated
      decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, the
      data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
    </p>

    <h2 id="content4">Security Measures</h2>
    <p>
      We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance
      with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the
      implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of
      processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risks to
      the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of security
      appropriate to the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality,
      integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic
      access to the data as well as the related access, input, transfer,
      securing availability, and separation. Furthermore, we have established
      procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion
      of data, and responses to data risks. Furthermore, we take the protection
      of personal data into account during the development or selection of
      hardware, software, and procedures in accordance with the principle of
      data protection by design and by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      TLS/SSL encryption (https): To protect the data of users that are
      transmitted via our online services, we use TLS/SSL encryption. Secure
      Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology for securing internet
      connections by encrypting data transmitted between a website or app and a
      browser (or between two servers). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an
      updated and more secure version of SSL. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
      Secure (HTTPS) is displayed in the URL when a website is secured by an
      SSL/TLS certificate.
    </p>

    <h2 id="content5">Deletion of Data</h2>
    <p>
      The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal
      requirements as soon as their permitted consents are revoked or other
      permissions cease to apply (e.g., if the purpose for processing this data
      no longer applies or is not necessary for the purpose). If the data is not
      deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes,
      its processing will be restricted to these purposes. This means that the
      data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies,
      for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or
      whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of
      legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or
      legal person. Our data protection notices may also contain further details
      on the retention and deletion of data, which take precedence for the
      respective processing operations.
    </p>

    <h2 id="content6">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
    <p>

        processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at

      </li>
    </ul>
