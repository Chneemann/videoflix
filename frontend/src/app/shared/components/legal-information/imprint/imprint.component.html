    <h3>Liability for Content</h3>

    <p>
      The contents of our pages were created with the utmost care. However, we
      cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the
      contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on
      these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG under general law. According to §§
      8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to
      monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate
      circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block
      the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However,
      liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time when a
      specific infringement becomes known. Upon notification of such violations,
      we will remove this content immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Liability for Links</h3>

    <p>
      Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose
      content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
      for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
      pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The
      linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
      linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
      Permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without
      concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon notification of violations, we
      will remove such links immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Copyright</h3>

    <p>
      The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
      subject to German copyright law. Duplication, editing, distribution, and
      any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the
      written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies
      of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar
      as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the
      copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party
      content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a
      copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of
      violations, we will remove such content immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Protection</h3>

    <p>
      The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal
      information. Insofar as personal data (e.g., name, address, or email
      addresses) are collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary
      basis as far as possible. These data will not be passed on to third
      parties without your explicit consent. We point out that data transmission
      over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security gaps.
      Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.
      The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation
      by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information
      materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages
      expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the
      unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
